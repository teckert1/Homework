## Landscape:

* Currencycloud is in banking and specifically focuses on optimizing transactions in foreign exchange or Forex.

* The digital banking domains of Foreign Exchange and Foreign Transfers are experiencing exponential growth right now. From in person currency exchanges and opening foreign accounts with hundreds of pages of paperwork to buying and selling currency or exchanging currency with a few clicks through a mobile app. Crypto currencies and blockchain technology are invading the space offering secure, stabile transactions and cloud based technology making it possible from wherever you are. 

* Other major competitors in this domain are Adyen, TransferWise, Money Mover, WeSwap.

## Results

* Currencycloud is still waiting for its big splash in this industry. They have about $160 million in funding and are estimated to have about $30 million in annual revenue. 

* From the metrics that are available \(number of employees, funding, annual revenue\), Currencycloud is in the middle of the road for their domain. The largest comnpany has raised about 10x the capital and is earning about 7x the annual revenue of Currencycloud.

## Recommendations

* As Currencycloud continues to grow - it would be cool to see them offer something with more of a consumer level utility. A lot of the consumer level digital banking spaces are pretty crowded, so I think they should stay in ForEx and make it more approachable for entry level investors.

* Branching out away from B2B would help diversify their offerings and also help them grow as a company. 

* This new space would still use the same cloud based platforms with APIs, but it could also incorporate machine learning. Machine learning could adapt the platform and tailor it for each user, learning their habits and making recommendations on new positions. 

* These technologies are key to their growth because they maintain their current platform and allow for the introduction of new-to-market users through education via machine learning.
